## Overview
A basic task management application developed using React in three hours. This application allows users to track their tasks and is a learning project from my second week of learning React.

## Key Features
Task Management: Tracks tasks with titles and delete buttons.
State Management: Maintains a list of tasks as state, with each task represented as an object containing an ID and a title.
Task Deletion: Allows users to delete tasks from the list when they are completed.
Responsive Design: Uses flexbox for a responsive layout.

## Technical Details
Frontend Framework: Built using React.
Folder Structure: Maintains a consistent folder structure following clean code guidelines.
Naming Conventions: Uses meaningful naming conventions, such as prefixing event handlers with on and creating reusable components.
Hardcoded List: The list of tasks is hardcoded in this application.
